=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module aims to be a full implementation of a an object-oriented interface 
to the Audioscrobbler WebService API (as available on 
L<http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/>). Since version 0.04, the 
module fully supports data caching and, thus, complies to the service's 
recommended usage guides.

    use WebService::Audioscrobbler;

    my $ws = WebService::Audioscrobbler->new;

    # get an object for artist named 'foo'
    my $artist  = $ws->artist('foo');

    # retrieves tracks from 'foo'
    my @tracks = $artist->tracks;

    # retrieves tags associated with 'foo'
    my @tags = $artist->tags;

    # fetch artists similar to 'foo'
    my @similar = $artist->similar_artists;

    # prints each one of their names
    for my $similar (@similar) {
        print $similar->name . "\n";
    }

    ...

    # get an object for tag 'bar'
    my $tag = $ws->tag('bar');

    # fetch tracks tagged with 'bar'
    my @bar_tracks = $tag->tracks;

    ...

    my $user = $ws->user('baz');

    my @baz_neighbours = $user->neighbours;

Audioscrobbler is a great service for tracking musical data of various sorts,
and its integration with the LastFM service (L<http://www.last.fm>) makes it
work even better. Audioscrobbler provides data regarding similarity between
artists, artists discography, tracks by musical genre (actually, by tags), 
top artists / tracks / albums / tags and how all of that related to your own
musical taste.

Currently, only of subset of these data feeds are implemented, which can be 
viewed as the core part of the service: artists, tags, tracks and users. Since 
this module was developed as part of a automatic playlist building application 
(still in development) these functions were more than enough for its initial 
purposes but a (nearly) full WebServices API is planned. 

In any case, code or documentation patches are welcome.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 C<new([$cache_root]>

Creates a new C<WebService::Audioscrobbler> object. This object can then be 
used to retrieve various bits of information from the Audioscrobbler database. 
If C<$cache_root> is specified, Audioscrobbler data will be cached under this 
directory, otherwise it will use L<Cache::FileCache> defaults.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my ($cache_root) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;
    
    # creates the data fetcher object which will be extensively used
    $self->data_fetcher( 
        $self->data_fetcher_class->new( {
            base_url    =>  $self->base_url,
            cache_root  =>  $cache_root
        } )
    );

    $self;
}

=head2 C<artist($name)>

Returns an L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::Artist> object constructed using the 
given C<$name>. Note that this call doesn't actually check if the artist exists
since no remote calls are dispatched - the object is only constructed.

=cut

sub artist {
    my ($self, $artist) = @_;
    return $self->artist_class->new($artist, $self->data_fetcher);
}

=head2 C<track($artist, $title)>

Returns an L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::Track> object constructed used the 
given C<$artist> and C<$title>. The C<$artist> parameter can either be a 
L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::Artist> object or a string (in this case, a 
L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::Artist> will be created behind the scenes). Note 
that this call doesn't actually check if the track exists since no remote calls
are dispatched - the object is only constructed.

=cut

sub track {
    my ($self, $artist, $title) = @_;

    $artist = $self->artist($artist) 
        unless ref $artist; # assume the user knows what he's doing

    return $self->track_class->new($artist, $title, $self->data_fetcher);
}

=head2 C<tag($name)>

Returns an L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::Tag> object constructed using the given
C<$name>. Note that this call doesn't actually check if the tag exists since no
remote calls are dispatched - the object is only constructed.

=cut

sub tag {
    my ($self, $tag) = @_;
    return $self->tag_class->new($tag, $self->data_fetcher);
}

=head2 C<user($name)>

Returns an L<WebService::Audioscrobbler::User> object constructed using the given
C<$name>. Note that this call doesn't actually check if the user exists since no
remote calls are dispatched - the object is only constructed.

=cut

sub user {
    my ($self, $user) = @_;
    return $self->user_class->new($user, $self->data_fetcher);
}
